/**
 * Crawler regression tests. `node --test registry/scripts/`
 *
 * Node's own test runner, no dependencies, for the same reason the crawler has
 * none: this directory is extracted into a public repository whose CI installs
 * nothing.
 *
 * The crawler runs on import and resolves its files from its own directory, so
 * each case builds a throwaway registry — scripts, schema, curated files — and
 * runs it there with `fetch` stubbed. What it asserts is the part that is a
 * security property rather than a formatting one: `official` comes from
 * `official.json` and from nowhere else, including from ids that resolve on
 * `Object.prototype`.
